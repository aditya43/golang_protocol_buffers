## Advantages of Protocol Buffers:
- Data is fully typed.
- Data is compressed automatically (less CPU usage).
- `Schema` (defined using `.proto` file) is needed to generate code and read the data.
- Documentation can be embedded in the `Schema`.
- Data can be read across any language (C#, Java, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc..).
- `Schema` can evolve over time in a safe manner (`Schema` evolution).

- Code is generated for us automatically.
